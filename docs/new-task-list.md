## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema Updates
```sql
-- Remove agent role from users table
ALTER TABLE users MODIFY role ENUM('admin', 'customer') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'customer';

-- Update tickets table for single attachment
-- (Ensure proper foreign key relationships)
```

### Route Structure (Proposed)
```php
// Authentication routes
Route::get('/dashboard', [DashboardController::class, 'index'])->name('dashboard');

// Ticket routes
Route::resource('tickets', TicketController::class);
Route::post('tickets/{ticket}/comments', [CommentController::class, 'store']);

// Configuration routes (admin only)
Route::middleware(['auth', 'admin'])->prefix('admin')->group(function () {
    Route::resource('categories', CategoryController::class);
    Route::resource('departments', DepartmentController::class);
    Route::resource('priorities', PriorityController::class);
    Route::resource('statuses', StatusController::class);
    Route::resource('types', TypeController::class);
    Route::resource('users', UserController::class);
});
```

### File Attachment Implementation
```php
// In TicketController
public function store(StoreTicketRequest $request)
{
    // Single file attachment logic
    if ($request->hasFile('attachment')) {
        $path = $request->file('attachment')->store('attachments');
        // Store single attachment reference
    }
}
```
